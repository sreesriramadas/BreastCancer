The original Wisconsin-Breast Cancer (Diagnostics) dataset (WBC) from the UCI machine learning repository is a classification dataset that records breast cancer case measurements. There are two kinds of tumours: benign and malignant. To develop a breast cancer risk prediction model using logistic regression based on the descriptors of the National Mammography Database (NMD) format that can aid in decision-making for early diagnosis of breast cancer. Our logistic regression model can efficiently distinguish between benign and malignant breast disease and find the most critical breast cancer variables.
